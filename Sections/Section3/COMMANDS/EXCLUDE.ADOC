[[CANDE_COMMANDS_EXCLUDE_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The EXCLUDE command causes any line in the work file with the same sequence
number as a line in the specified <file title> to be deleted. Unmatched lines in the
excluded file are ignored. The UPDATE option is implicitly invoked after the EXCLUDE
option has been executed.

The EXCLUDE command is particularly helpful when used in combination with the FIND
command FILE option. This command should not be used with type DATA or CDATA
files because these files do not have sequence numbers stored in the text.
