[[CANDE_COMMANDS_DELETE_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The DELETE command causes the lines specified in the <sequence range list>
construct to be deleted from the work file. If DELETE ALL is entered, the contents of
the work file are deleted, but the title and other attributes are preserved. If the work
file is unnamed, it is removed by the DELETE ALL form.
