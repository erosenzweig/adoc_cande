[[CANDE_COMMANDS_ARCHIVE_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The DISCARD command allows removal of unwanted recovery files. DISCARD must
be followed by a recovery number or a list of recovery numbers. Refer to Section 1,
“General Information,” for a definition of recovery number.

*_Note:_* _Be cautious when you use the DISCARD command if your system is running
multiple copies of CANDE, and you are logged on to at least two copies of CANDE.
Because recovery files on one copy of CANDE are visible to other copies of CANDE,
it is possible to discard recovery files created under other copies of CANDE.
For more information about multiple copies of CANDE, refer to Section 1, "General
Information."_
