[[CANDE_COMMANDS_MARGIN_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The MARGIN command controls text entry at the left margin of a line by inserting a
specified number of blanks to the left of the text being entered. If MARGIN is entered,
the margin is set to column 1. If MARGIN ? is entered, the current margin setting is
displayed.

If the <column> option is specified, <column> represents an absolute column number
where the text is to start. If the + <number of columns> or â€“ <number of columns>
option is specified, <number of columns> is relative to the previous margin setting.
If a colon (:) is specified, the margin specification applies only to the single-line entry
that follows.

Margin specifications can be specified in single-line sequencing mode by using the at
sign (@) as the first character after the system-supplied sequence number. The margin
specification applies only to the line on which it appears. The :<sequence number>
option cannot be used with the at sign (@). The @ form of the MARGIN command
cannot be used in page mode. A line overflow may occur as a result of indentation. A
message is displayed, and the resulting line is truncated.
