[[CANDE_COMMANDS_CONTINUE_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The CONTINUE command enables you to define, reset, or interrogate a continuation
character. The continuation character indicates that a line of input is to be continued.

CANDE interprets a line of normal input (that is, a line not beginning with the control
character for the userâ€™s station) as needing to be continued when the defined
continuation character is the last character of input. CANDE removes the continuation
character and inserts one blank in its place. CANDE sends #% as a continuation
prompt. The next line of input is then appended to this line.

CANDE does not continue a line of normal input entered in sequence mode or page
mode. (CANDE treats a defined continuation character entered in page or sequence
mode as text.)

*CONTINUE* +
Entering CONTINUE without an option undefines the continuation character.

*CONTINUE ?* +
Entering CONTINUE ? displays your currently defined continuation character. If a
continuation character is not currently defined, then the following message is
returned:

----
#NO CONTINUATION CHARACTER DEFINED
----

*CONTINUE ** +
Entering CONTINUE * sets the continuation character to the default value defined for
it in the USERDATAFILE. If the default continuation character is not defined there, the
tasking-only continuation character (%) is recognized as the default.

*CONTINUE = <special character>* +
Entering CONTINUE=<special character> defines the specified special character as
the new continuation character. Any special character except the semicolon (;) can be
used for the continuation character.

The following CONTINUE command sets the continuation character to the special
character ampersand (&):

----
CONTINUE = &
----

*CONTINUE = <control char mnemonic>* +
Entering CONTINUE=<control char mnemonic> defines the specified control
character mnemonic as a new continuation character. Any special character except
the semicolon (;) can be used for the continuation character.

To define a control character mnemonic as a continuation character, use the ESCAPE
HEXADECIMAL CANDE command to define a special character to delimit a sequence
of EBCDIC hexadecimal values for the nonprintable character.

For example, to define the carriage return (CR) as a continuation character in a DO file
named CONTINUE/TEST, do the following:

. Define a special character as the delimiter for the EBCDIC hexadecimal value of
the nonprintable character. In this example, the exclamation point is defined as the
special character by the ESCAPE HEXADECIMAL command.
ESCAPE HEX = !

. In the DO file CONTINUE/TEST, enter the CONTINUE command to define the
carriage return (CR) as the control character mnemonic for the continuation
character.
100 CONTINUE = CR

. Use the newly defined continuation character by continuing an input line with the
hexadecimal value representation for carriage return (CR) delimited by the
exclamation point (!).

[start=4]
. You can optionally redefine the continuation character to the default.

The following example illustrates the previous steps taken, the records of the
resultant DO file CONTINUE/TEST, and the results of running the DO file:

----
ESCAPE HEX = !
#ESCAPE HEXADECIMAL = !

MAKE CONTINUE/TEST; S

100 CONTINUE = CR

[[CANDE_COMMANDS_CONTINUE_EXPLANATION_DEFAULTCONTINUATIONCHARACTER]]
===== Default Continuation Character
You can have a default continuation character defined in your USERDATAFILE. The
CANDECONTCHAR option is initialized at the start of each CANDE session as the
default continuation character. You can override the default character during a
particular session by using the CONTINUE command. Refer to the Security
Administration Guide for more information about the USERDATAFILE.

If no continuation character is defined in the USERDATAFILE, then the percent sign (%)
is the default continuation character for task-type commands only. For example, RUN
is a task-type command. You can change the continuation character at any time with
the CONTINUE command.

If this system default continuation character is in effect, a query of the continuation
character results in the following message:

----
TASKING-ONLY CONTINUATION CHARACTER (%) DEFINED
----

[[CANDE_COMMANDS_CONTINUE_EXPLANATION_USINGTHECONTINUATIONCHARACTERINADOFILE]]
===== Using the Continuation Character in a DO File
When a continuation character is defined and that character appears as the last
character of a line of input, CANDE interprets that character as a request for the input
line to be continued. A situation where a previously defined continuation character is
again defined (such as in a DO file in the following example) can result in an error
condition.

For example, assume that the continuation character has already been defined as the
plus sign (+) and the following DO file named TEST/CHAR is run:

----
LIST TEST/CHAR

100 CONT = +
200 FILES +
300 TEMP
DO TEST/CHAR
#FILE (USER)TEST/CHAR ON MYPACK
#
CONT=+
FILES +

#KEYWORD EXPECTED. SCANNING FILES
----

The error results because the continuation character plus sign (+) on line 100 of the
TEST/CHAR file is interpreted as requesting a continuation of another input line rather
than the plus sign (+) character being defined as a continuation character.

You can circumvent this error condition in one of two ways:

. In the DO file TEST/CHAR, undefine the current continuation character by entering:
----
CONTINUE
----
. Redefine the continuation character in the DO file:
----
CONTINUE = +
----

The DO file TEST/CHAR is modified to the following:

----
LIST TEST/CHAR
050 CONTINUE
100 CONT = +
200 FILES +
300 TEMP
----

[[CANDE_COMMANDS_CONTINUE_EXPLANATION_USINGTHESEMICOLONTOTERMINATETHECONTINUECOMMAND]]
===== Using the Semicolon (;) to Terminate the CONTINUE Command
Another method you can use to avoid the previously described error condition in a DO
file is to place a semicolon (;) after the CONTINUE command. The semicolon signals to
CANDE that it is to execute the CONTINUE command. The next input line is then read
and the plus sign (+) is recognized as the continuation character.

In the following DO file, the CONTINUE command is followed by a semicolon (;).

----
100 CONT = +;
200 FILES +
300 TEMP
