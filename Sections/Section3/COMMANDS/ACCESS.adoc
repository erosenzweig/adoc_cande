[[CANDE_COMMANDS_ACCESS_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The ACCESS command is used to interrogate or change the accesscode of a session.
When ACCESS is entered, the current accesscode for the session is returned (not
including the accesscode password).

The ACCESS form assigns a null accesscode to the session. If the
ACCESSCODENEEDED attribute is set in the USERDATAFILE for the usercode, the
request is denied.

The ACCESS <accesscode>/<apassword> form assigns or change the sessionâ€™s
accesscode and corresponding accesscode password after validation in the
USERDATAFILE. The ACCESS command does not alter the USERDATAFILE. If the
<apassword> is not supplied, it is requested.

The ACCESS <accesscode> form is used when no accesscode password exists for a
particular accesscode.

On systems with the Secure Access Control Module or Password Management
security packages, the accesscode password must be entered on a separate line (and
usually in a protected field), if the security option SECUREPASSWORDS is set.

Changes of accesscodes to a session are logged.

*_Note:_* If the CASESENSITIVEPW security option is set, passwords must be entered in a case-sensitive form.

For additional information on accesscodes, refer to "User Identification and Logging
On" in Section 1, "General Information."
