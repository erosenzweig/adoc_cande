[[CANDE_COMMANDS_CATALOG_EXPLANATION]]
==== Explanation
The CATALOG command applies only to a cataloging system. Cataloging provides an
automated method for locating copies of files that are on disk or tape.

The CATALOG command is processed by the Work Flow Language (WFL), not CANDE.
The command (and any text appearing on the same line) is passed unedited to WFL.

For a more detailed explanation, refer to the CATALOG statement in the WFL
Programming Reference Manual.
